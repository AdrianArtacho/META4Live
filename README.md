Use CLIP NAMES to establish the range of incoming midi notes accepted in this particular track.


  **lefta**                  Will only let through the keyboard keys left to the first ‘PAGE’ (usually midi 48)


  **righta**          Will only let through the keyboard keys right to the last ‘PAGE’


  **left 8vaa**          Additionally, the incoming notes will be transposed +12 semitones (up)...


  **left 8baa**          … or -12 semitones (down)


  **8baa**          If no left / right command is entered, the transposition will apply to all notes.
